This is the problem statememt:
Prove that the Borel sigma-algebra, which is a collection of subsets of a set, exhibits a property called \"antitonicity\" with respect to subset inclusion. In simpler terms, if we have two sets where one is contained within the other, the Borel sigma-algebra generated by the smaller set is also contained within the Borel sigma-algebra generated by the larger set.
this is the proof:
1. Let's consider two sets, A and B, where A is a subset of B. We aim to demonstrate that the Borel sigma-algebra generated by A, denoted as Borel(A), is contained within the Borel sigma-algebra generated by B, denoted as Borel(B).\n2. To prove this, we need to show that every set in Borel(A) is also present in Borel(B).\n3. Recall that the Borel sigma-algebra is generated by open sets. Therefore, it suffices to show that every open set belonging to Borel(A) also belongs to Borel(B).\n4. Since A is a subset of B, any open set contained in A is automatically an open set contained in B.\n5. As Borel(B) includes all open sets within B, it necessarily encompasses all open sets within A.\n6. Consequently, every generating set of Borel(A) is present in Borel(B).\n7. Utilizing the property of sigma-algebras that if all generating sets of one are contained in another, then the first is a subset of the second, we conclude that Borel(A) is contained within Borel(B).\n8. This establishes the antitonicity property of the Borel sigma-algebra: if A is a subset of B, then Borel(A) is a subset of Borel(B).

Can you break up these proofs into statements (statements are states of the proof that get simplified with each tactic) I just want the statements without the tactics
